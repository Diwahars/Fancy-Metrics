Fancy Metrics
============
- Bootstrap 3.1.1 http://getbootstrap.com/
- ChartJS http://www.chartjs.org/
- PHP / MYSQL to retreive metrics (all PDO)

See the screenshot (screen.png) for an example.

Note that in my case all credentials would be stored in
include 'config.inc.php';

Calculations and MYSQL Queries are in
functions.php

These will vary depending on your application and metrics.
